		setTimeout(() => {
			resolve(x);
		}, 2000);
	});
}

// async function expression assigned to a variable
const add = async function (x) {
	const a = await resolveAfter2Seconds(20);
	const b = await resolveAfter2Seconds(30);
	return x + a + b;
};

add(10).then((v) => {

# Building Blocks of the Web

Behind every captivating website, from minimalist blogs to dynamic e-commerce platforms, lies the humble language of HTML. These unassuming tags and elements form the backbone of every web page, defining its structure and content, ready to be styled and animated into a visual masterpiece.

## Designing with CSS

While HTML provides the structure, CSS steps in to add the flair. It's the master stylist, dictating colors, fonts, layouts, and animations, transforming a basic web page into a visually engaging experience. From subtle gradients to bold typography, CSS unlocks a world of creative possibilities, ensuring every element looks its best.

### JavaScript's Dynamic Touch

When a website feels alive, it's often JavaScript working its magic behind the scenes. This versatile language adds interactivity and responsiveness, enabling elements to respond to user actions, create dynamic animations, and power complex web applications. From seamless form validation to immersive games, JavaScript brings web experiences to life.

#### The Quest for Accessibility

Web development isn't just about visual appeal; it's about inclusivity. Building accessible websites ensures everyone can enjoy the online world, regardless of their abilities. Semantic HTML, alternative text for images, and keyboard navigation are just a few tools that empower users with disabilities to experience the web fully.

##### Responsive Design

Adapting to Every Screen: In a world of diverse devices, responsive design reigns supreme. It's the art of crafting websites that fluidly adapt to different screen sizes, ensuring seamless experiences on desktops, tablets, and smartphones alike. Flexible layouts, media queries, and thoughtful content prioritization create harmonious experiences across the digital landscape.

###### The Ever-Evolving Landscape

Web development is a realm of constant innovation. New technologies, frameworks, and best practices emerge continuously, pushing the boundaries of what's possible online. Staying curious and embracing continuous learning are essential traits for web developers who seek to create impactful and engaging digital experiences.

## Lists

### Unordered

- Create a list by starting a line with `-`
- Sub-lists are made by indenting 2 spaces:
  - Marker character change forces new list start:
    - Ac tristique libero volutpat at
    - Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet
    - Nulla volutpat aliquam velit
- Very easy!

  - Nulla volutpat aliquam velit

- Start a list by using a hyphen at the beginning of a line.
- If you want sub-lists, just indent by two spaces:
  - Changing the marker to a different character starts a new list:
    - Lorem ipsum tristique libero volutpat at
    - Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet
    - Nulla volutpat aliquam velit
  - It's quite simple!
